# Example jupyter notebook for interacting with https://inmap.run

Refer to file `eieio_example.ipynb` for futher information.

## Installation

    ./build.sh

The build script assumes that Docker is installed. If Docker is not installed,
things can be set up using steps similar to those in `Dockerfile`

## Running

    ./run.sh

If not using Docker, it can be run in the normal way of running Jupyter notebooks.

## Editing

The docker container should print out a web address you can visit in a browser, then go to the "work" subdirectory in the jupyter interface to the the workbook.
